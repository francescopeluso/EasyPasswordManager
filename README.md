## What does this script do?

Simply, you can generate random passwords, as long as you want, and register them in a local JSON file.

## Why did I create this when there are hundreds of programs that do the same thing, and even better?

Because I'm just moving my first steps into serious coding, and to practice more on this language that I have almost always neglected.

## Execution example

```bash
## UPDATED TO VERSION 1.0

$ python3 password_generator.py 

How much long the password has to be? >> 16
Your password is: v6dgsKju8JajCYXr
Would you like to associate this password with one of you accounts?
[Insert the name of the platform, or leave blank] >> GitHub
```

## TO-DO list:
- [ ] Improve password managing in JSON file.
- [x] Improve text formatting, maybe?
- [ ] idk, I'll figure it out...
